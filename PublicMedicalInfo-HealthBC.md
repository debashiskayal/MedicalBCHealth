1) Family Doctor/ GP : You and your family will need to register with a GP or Family Doctor. This doc will be the first POC for anything that is non-emergency, for regular checkups, tests approval, regular medications. If any one family member is already registerd with a GP then they usually will also accept the spouse and children as patients automatically. To search for family doctor: (1) use medimap.ca (2) blind search in google with doctors near me accepting patients (3) Keep visiting the nearest UPCC and add yourself to their waiting list 
Once you have registered for GP - ensure to store the Doc name, clinic name and address info as sometimes these are questions asked by testing centres/UPCC/ER 

3) UPCC: In case you dont have a GP or if it is afterhours (typically all family doctors shut shop by 4:30 PM and are available only on weekdays) then you may visit UPCC to avail non-emergency primary care. Note : they usually dont take appointments and there is always a long wait so plan accordingly. 

4) Medicinces: Nothing other than paracetamol (PCM or acetaminophen APAP), ibuprofen (or similar analgesics) are available OTC. Most commonly missed (by us Indians) will be Antibiotics, and specific medicines like Thyroxine (for hypothyroid), ecosprin/sorbitrate (blood thinners), metformin (sugar control) and telmasartan (pressure med) etc 

Availability: come flu season (starting Aug-end till Nov) Advil, Tylenol (similar to our Crocin, Dolo, PCM) will be scarce -especially the paediatric/children version. 
Work around: (1) Stock up (during India / US visits) (2) Call around pharmacies - some will have stock (3) Visit compounding pharmacies (they 'make' the desired meds but are a bit pricey)     

Medicine Costs: All pharmacies charge something called Prescription Service Charge - this tends to be a fixed fee (of ~ $10) per prescription. Sometimes they break up the dosage and charge you everytime you come to pick up the same meds. For example - if the doc prescribes you 3 month medicine - it is better to take all the medicine at once instead of coming back 3 times each month - as each time they process your prescription they add that service charge. The cost of the medicine remains same. They do this more if they see that there is an insurance covering cost of medicine. So be careful.
